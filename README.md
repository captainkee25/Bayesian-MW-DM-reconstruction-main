# Bayesian-MW-DM-reconstruction
This repository includes the datafiles, code, results and plots for a Bayesian determination of the Milky Way's dark matter distribution and local dark matter density. We tested a model with an NFW dark matter profile, and another with the addition of two dark matter rings to this profile. The corresponding files are termed "no rings" and "rings respectively".  

The  report of our findings was submitted as the final assignment for the course "402-0738-10L Bayesian Statistical Methods and Data Analysis HS2024" at ETH Zurich.
